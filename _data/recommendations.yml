  image: engin.akyol.jpg
  content: Kyle joined Distil Networks at a time when we had no coherent data strategy, competing data sources and no real way of guaranteeing data integrity in an environment where our data volume was growing aggressively month over month. Over the course of three years, Kyle implemented his vision into a Data Platform that today supports an entire ecosystem of services and consumers that includes customers, support engineers, security analysts and data scientists. Distil Networks would simply not be anywhere near as effective as it is today were it not for Kyle's vision and technical implementation.  Kyle has made a permanent technical, cultural and personal impact at Distil Networks and will absolutely be a huge positive impact at whatever new opportunities he pursues.

In the time I had the pleasure to work with him, there was not a single challenge he ever let get the best of him.

And in addition to that, he’s a fantastic gentleman to work with.
